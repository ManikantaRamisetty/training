1. "The Tortoise and the Hare"

Once upon a time in a forest, there lived a speedy hare and a slow but determined tortoise. The hare was always bragging about how fast he was, while the tortoise remained quiet. Tired of the hare's boasting, the tortoise challenged him to a race.

The race began, and the hare sprinted ahead, leaving the tortoise far behind. Confident of his victory, the hare decided to take a nap. Meanwhile, the tortoise kept plodding along at a steady pace.

To everyone's surprise, when the hare woke up, he found the tortoise at the finish line. The slow and steady tortoise had won the race, proving that consistency and determination triumph over arrogance.

2. "The Boy Who Cried Wolf"

In a small village, there was a mischievous boy named Jack. He often got bored while tending the village's sheep and would cry out, "Wolf! Wolf!" just for fun. The villagers would rush to help, only to find no wolf.

One day, a real wolf appeared and threatened the sheep. Jack screamed for help, but this time, no one came because they thought he was tricking them again. Sadly, the wolf devoured the sheep.

Jack learned a valuable lesson: dishonesty has consequences
